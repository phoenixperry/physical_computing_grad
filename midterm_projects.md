Drawing Machine

Notes: 
* Fritzing allows you to align your circuit diagram on a grid 
* Construction could be more robust 
* The degrees of freedom for the drawing module could be more fixed to allow it to operate longer.

Sensor - Sound - Particles 

Notes: 
* The casing is lacking 
* In the future, focus on the physical as much as the software 
* I like the in situation rendering 
* lovely audio 
* nice visualization 
* no diagram 
* give more degrees of freedom to the user to control the sound / visual experience

No kill mouse trap 
Notes: 
* I love this idea
* great casing and common household objects
* Good use of hardware 
* fritzing use the grid 
* exceeds assignment in terms of hardware and number of outputs
