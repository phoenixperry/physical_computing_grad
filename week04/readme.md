##Lab Task 4

**Instructions:**

You can do one of two projects 

Project 1: Make an analog synthesizer with at least once oscillator and two input modalities 

Project 2: Make a one button game using touch inputs that has at least one output modality   


For people who want to make the synth, you'll need to pick up a cheap little BATTERY POWERED amp. 

You can do that here: http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00CLC9AQ0?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o06_s00

Or really anywhere around the internet that sells amps. Also you'll need a jack to match, most likely a quarter inch input jack. I found mine on amazon here:

Just hack open the sleeve and attach the short end to ground. 

For folks who want to make the touch game, you'll need the capsense library and sample code here:

Bouns points? I capacitive touch audio game but of course.... Impress me.
