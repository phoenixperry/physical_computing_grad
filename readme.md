About the class: 
Welcome to Physical Computing. 

You can find the course description on the departmental website. Each class I might ask you to bring in seemingly non-sensical items. They will be critical to your lab projects so don't neglect them. 

**Participation** consists of not only turning up to class and labs, being active in lectures and discussions, and contributing to the online forums. These are requirements to get the very bare minimum pass. 

I really care about your competence, your passion, your bravery, your curiosity, your civic spirit, your generosity, your critical questioning and your moral compass.

I take for granted you will successfully fulfill the objectives above which are measurable such as attendance, participation, doing your homework and presenting your projects. Do not let yourself down in these ways.


**Lectures and Labs**
I present the course material in the Physical Computing Lab (Ben Pimlott Bldg - GDS). You are expected to attend all of these sessions.

Assessment
Your overall mark for this course consists of four major components, each of which contribute differently to your overall score. The contribution of each of the assessment criteria are:


####Assessment

#####You must complete all of the above items for full credit, according to the following requirements:etextile-summetextile-summercamp.org/swatch-exchange/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/SwatchBookExchange2015_PDF_spreads.pdfetextile-summercamp.org/swatch-exchange/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/SwatchBookExchange2015_PDF_spreads.pdfercamp.org/swatch-exchange/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/SwatchBookExchange2015_PDF_spreads.pdf

**The Major Projects** must also include your project log and the working final project presentation (or video). Details about the Major Projects are provided as the term progresses.

**Coursework** (Lab Tasks 1-4) consists of lab tasks assigned each week. Your must keep an online log which must be detailed, and must include a video and diagrams. At the end of the 4 labs, you must select and submit one which you want to be marked formally. At the end of the 4 weeks this mark will be given the weight of 70% of your lab work and your week by week labs and logs will account for the other 30% of your lab work mark. 

**The Viva** is a formal presentation of your Major Project.

**How your Labs will be marked in class and the following will be givMain Page - 32C3_Public_Wikien consideration in their marking:**

5 (1st) - Exceeded what was discussed in class, evidence of external research, and exceeded assignment expectations

4 (2.1) - Very good use of what is taught in the course and possible some small elements beyond it

3 (2.2) - No so polished, may have missed some things but the work was done

2 (3) - Some requirements not fulfilled/not fully complProjectseted. 

1 - Warrants a pass, but not more.

0 - Didn't do the work or couldn't present it. Fail.
Further criteria contributing to the mark:

QUALITY OF DOCUMENTATION
Readable, dated, titled, evidence of progressive completion

KNOWLEDGE AND UNDERSTANDING
Underlying physics, principles of microcontrollers, sensors and actuators, code

REQUIREMENTS/AIMS
A clear statement of your aim(s)

DESIGN
Schematics, code and any other hardware design

PROPER IMPLEMENTATION
How the project was actually set-up

ADDITIONAL, SELF-MOTIVATED WORK
Have you taken the work a bit further? Have you done more than what was asked for in the Task for that week? This is a good way to get a high mark.


####How your Major Projects will be marked:
---
70+ (1st) - Exceeded what was discussed in class, evidence of external research, and exceeded assignment expectations

60-70 (2.1) - Very good use of what is taught in the course and possible some small elements beyond it

50-60 (2.2) - No so polished, may have missed some things but the work was done

40-50 (3) - Some requirements not fulfilled/not fully completed. Warrants a pass, but not more.
